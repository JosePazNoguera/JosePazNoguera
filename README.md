I am JosÃ©, I am passionate about data and statistics. I dream a world where data helps making better decisions and allow more transparency in the public sector.

I have worked as a consultant for more than 5 years in Madrid and London. I am specialised in the passenger transport sector. Ask me questions about transport economics and I might tell you something that makes sense.
